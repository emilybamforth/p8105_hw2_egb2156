## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data\!

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df =
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

``` r
median(pull(trashwheel_df, sports_balls))
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
mean(pull(precip_2017, total))
```

    ## [1] 2.744167

``` r
mean(pull(precip_2018, total))
```

    ## [1] 5.860833

This dataset contains information about Mr. Trashwheel, a trash
collector in Baltimore, MD, including the `year`, `month`, `weight_tons`
of dumpsters filled, and the types of trash collected. There are 344
rows in the final Mr. Trashwheel dataset. The median number of
`sports_balls` in a dumpster in 2017 was `8` balls. We also have
information about precipitation by `year` and by `month`. For
precipitation across 2017 and 2018, we have 24 rows in the final
dataset. The average rainfall in 2017 was `2.74` inches; in 2018, the
average rainfall was `5.86` inches.

## Problem 2

Read data.

``` r
station_df =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:ada) %>% 
  select(-exit_only, -staffing, -staff_hours) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset looks at the entrances and exits of NYC subway stations.
There are 1868 rows and 19 columns in the dataset. The dataset includes
information about routes served, entrance types and whether they are
ADA-compliant. So far we have read the data, cleaned the variable names
using `clean_names`, selected the variables we wanted to look at and
converted `entry` into a logical variable. However, this dataset is not
yet tidy, since there is not one observation per row. Instead, we have
multiple observations for each subway station.

Answering some more questions:

``` r
distinct_stations = station_df %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name) %>%
  nrow()

ada_compliant_stations = station_df %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(ada) %>%
  nrow()

no_vending = station_df %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>%
  nrow()

no_vending_with_entry = station_df %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(vending == "NO" & entry == TRUE) %>%
  nrow()
```

In this dataset, there are 465 distinct stations. 84 stations are
ADA-compliant. Out of 9 stations without vending, 5 allow entrance.

Reformatting data:

``` r
long_df = station_df %>%
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("route")), as.character) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols  = starts_with("route"),
               names_to = "route_number",
               names_prefix = "route",
               values_to = "route_name")

a_stations = long_df %>%
  filter(route_name == "A") %>%
  nrow()

ada_a_stations = long_df %>%
  filter(route_name == "A" & ada == TRUE) %>%
  nrow()
```

Out of 273 distinct stations that serve the A train, 107 are ADA
compliant.
